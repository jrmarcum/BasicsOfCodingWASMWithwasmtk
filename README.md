# Basics of Coding WASM with wasmtk
## Preface
What this text is and what it is not: This text is intended to introduce the reader to the basics of WebAssembly programming in the sense that they will be able to write minimal types of programs and compile and run them as WASM modules. It is not intended to go into advanced topics like multi-threading, shared memory, SIMD, or WebAssembly component model.

The programs are intended to be run in the terminal as that is common to most operating systems. Linux and Mac come preinstalled with a terminal. Windows may or may not have it pre-installed. "Windows Terminal" can be installed from the Microsoft store. Just do a search for it and install it.
## Installation and Setup of wasmtk
To set up wasmtk, install [Deno](https://deno.com/) first, then install wasmtk from JSR:
```
$ deno install -g -A jsr:@jrmarcum/wasmtk
```
If wasmtk has been installed properly you will be able to type the following command in the terminal command line and receive the response shown:
```
$ wasmtk --version
wasmtk v1.5.4
(Note: the version shown here varies with your installed version)
```
## How to Run Examples

Each lesson folder contains a `.ts` (TypeScript) source file and a `.md` file showing the run command and expected output. wasmtk compiles the TypeScript to a standalone WASI module and runs it — no separate compilation step needed.

Navigate into the lesson folder and run with `wasmtk run`:

```
$ cd 01_hello-world
$ wasmtk run hello-world.ts
hello world
```

You can also compile to a `.wasm` binary first and then run it separately — the output is identical:

```
$ wasmtk wasic hello-world.ts
$ wasmtk run hello-world.wasm
hello world
```

Use `wasmtk info` to inspect the exported functions and metadata of any compiled binary:

```
$ wasmtk info hello-world.wasm
```
